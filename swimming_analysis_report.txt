Swimming Performance Analysis Report
Athlete: [Name]
Date: July 02, 2024

Executive Summary:
The analysis reveals an average body angle deviation of 0.0 degrees from horizontal across all strokes.
This indicates a need for focused improvement in maintaining a streamlined position.

Stroke-specific Analysis:

Breaststroke (from 3629-172488406_small.mp4):
Areas for Improvement:
- Improve body position: Your body is at a 16.8 degree angle. Aim for
  a more horizontal position
- Improve body position: Your body is at a 15.6 degree angle. Aim for
  a more horizontal position
- Improve timing: Coordinate your arm pull and leg kick for better
  propulsion
- Improve your catch: Keep your elbow high during the pull phase for
  better propulsion
- Increase body rotation: Rotate your body more with each stroke for
  better efficiency

Strengths:
- Good timing: Your arm pull and leg kick are well-coordinated
- Good kick width: Your knees are at an appropriate width for an
  efficient breaststroke kick
- Efficient pull: Your arm pull is appropriately narrow
- Efficient glide: You're maintaining a good streamline position
  during the glide phase
- Good arm recovery: Your elbows are positioned correctly during the
  recovery phase

Overall Recommendations:
1. Focus on core strength and body awareness exercises to improve overall body alignment
2. Practice stroke-specific drills to address individual technique issues
3. Utilize underwater video analysis for visual feedback on body position
4. Work with a coach on mental cues for maintaining proper alignment during swims

Next Steps:
1. Develop a targeted training plan addressing key areas for improvement
2. Schedule follow-up analysis in 3 months to assess progress
3. Consider additional equipment like alignment boards or snorkels for technique work
